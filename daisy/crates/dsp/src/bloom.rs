//! Resonant "bloom" bank — a small set of band-pass [`Svf`]s tuned to a fixed
//! chord (D Lydian) that ring pitched tone *out of* the program material when
//! excited. Fed from the pre-tape master tap, so its input is the rain / street
//! noise / pads of the composition itself — broadband noise into a high-Q
//! band-pass is the classic way to bloom a pitch out of nothing, so no new
//! notes are introduced: the track resonates itself.
//!
//! Driven by a single `amount` in `[0, 1]` ("proximity"):
//! - `0.0` — far: resonators at low Q, every voice's envelope at zero → silent.
//! - `1.0` — near: high Q, all voices open, the source *sings* into the chord.
//!
//! Voices enter progressively as `amount` rises (`onset`/`width` per voice).
//! The final voice is the Lydian **#4 (G#)** — its `onset` is high so it only
//! blooms in the closest band, surfacing the floating Lydian color as a payoff
//! when you lean all the way in, and dropping out first as you withdraw.
//!
//! Per-sample work is `NUM_VOICES` double-sampled SVF ticks and needs **no
//! delay buffer**, so unlike the ping-pong delay it has no SDRAM concern on the
//! embedded target.
