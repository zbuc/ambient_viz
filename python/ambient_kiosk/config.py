# reach the full 4 m in long mode (dark, white target). The Adafruit lib accepts
# a discrete set {15,20,33,50,100,200,500}, so long mode uses 200 ms (the next
# value ≥140) to guarantee the 4 m reach — at the cost of a ~5 Hz ranging rate,
# which the hold/snap logic and browser EMA absorb. Mode-dependent so short mode
# keeps its fast 50 Hz feel. VL53_TIMING_BUDGET_MS is the short/default used for

# the scene is dark enough to support it; otherwise short mode, which is far
# more ambient-tolerant. VL53_AMBIENT_LONG_MAX is in ST ULD units and MUST be

# --- Empty-room distance learning -------------------------------------------
# The far end of every distance→effect mapping (the "full destruction" point,
# published as distance_far_cm) should be the ACTUAL empty-room reading, not a
# fixed guess. The VL53L1X reflects off whatever surface it faces, so even a
# clear line of sight may return a finite distance (e.g. ~350 cm off a far
# wall) rather than no-target. We learn that background live from the feed:
# when the smoothed distance holds essentially still — velocity below the
# threshold — for longer than the stillness window, nobody is moving in the
# cone, so the current reading IS the room, and we adopt it as the far reach.
#
# Re-learned continuously so it tracks the room over time (furniture moved, the
# sensor nudged or repositioned post-bootup, a new backdrop). Adoption is
# deliberately asymmetric: a stable reading FARTHER than the current estimate
# is trusted immediately (a clearer line of sight can only mean the previous
# estimate was occluded), while a CLOSER one is adopted slowly — a visitor
# standing dead-still is closer than the wall and must NOT pull the baseline
# in, or the empty room would read as "someone's here" forever.

# sensor vibration / thermal drift (sub-cm/s), well under human motion. Gauged

# which resolves sub-cm/s (a per-sample derivative is swamped by jitter at
# 50 Hz) and is robust to small zero-mean wobble.

# the exhibit can't become the max distance, and it never lowers the baseline.
