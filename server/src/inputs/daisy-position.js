// governs the "empty" baseline, and the AM312's blindness to a perfectly still

// both the AM312's ~2 s internal drop and its stillness-blindness (a visitor
// who stops moving keeps counting as present until the hold lapses). All three
// presence triggers key off this fused occupancy: the entry bell fires on the
// empty->occupied edge (motion onset, or a ToF approach), voice-on-leave on the
// confirmed empty edge, and the toll while occupied. With the flag OFF each
// reverts to its pure-distance path — the entry bell to its sustained-approach
// gate, voice/toll to distance hysteresis.
